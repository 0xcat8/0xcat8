Hello, welcome to my GitHub Page.

ðŸ‘‰ I'm Daniel Krupnik, I mainly specialize in writing plugins for AMX Mod X, but I also enjoy writing codes in PHP as a hobby.

ðŸ‘‰ Feel free to Contact me on Steam if you would like a paid AMXX job for you

Besides coding, I work as an IT administrator, ensuring systems run smoothly and securely.
